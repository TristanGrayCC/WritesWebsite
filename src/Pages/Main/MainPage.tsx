    Paid to unearth the fate of the children of the Three Willows, Fiadh expects
    the work of a predatory fey.
    <br />
    <br /> But this was a very different kind of monster who preyed upon the
    village folk. One that would leave her no choice but to journey into the
    wilderness beyond.
    <br />
    <br /> Experience an adventure in the world of Seann Àite, inspired by the
    myths and folklore of dark age Scotland.

    haunted lord of the isle from the shadows that torment him in the night.

    <br /> Now pursued by a shadowy order and with a new companion at her side,
    Fiadh has a chance to unveil some of the secrets of her past.

    Fiadh and Annis must brave the dealings and secrets of a house long lost to
    time, and somehow find a way to placate the monster that awaits their

    Long ago the gods of Seann Àite departed the world in the midst of a great
    battle fought high in the mountains above the Giants' Stair. Now that tale
    will be told by a diminutive storyteller, as Fiadh and Annis seek the only
    way to find the Red Raven - a wish.
    <br />
    <br /> Accompanied by companions from the crew of her host Fiadh will climb
    in search of one of the few beings capable of granting her what she needs.
    All the while, the cracks of her long and gruelling journey begin to show.{" "}

    Now, finally, she will meet her in person, with Annis at her side.

    for more than her vengeance.

    In a treacherous world filled with deception and distrust, Fiadh the Crow
    had plied her trade ridding the people of the Seann Àite of spirits and
    monsters.
    <br />
    <br />
    Beneath it all lies whispers in the dark leading men astray, whispers from a
    world beyond her own. Dark pacts are struck, and innocent souls are
    sacrificed for the promise of power from beyond.
    <br />
    <br />
    Far from home, Fiadh travels seeking answers gripping the fell blade
    Caerdrich. Together they journey the seas seeking revenge for the loss those
    whispers brought them so long ago.
