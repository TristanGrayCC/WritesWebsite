            This consultation is deliberately designed to exhaust creatives who
            are low on time, and every hour spent filling in FIFTY PLUS
            questions laid out in this dense format removes them from the work
            that they need to keep their often precarious situations afloat.
            This advantages Generative AI companies, who are wealthy enough to
            employ teams of lawyers to complete these consultations on their
            behalf.

            I hope by providing my own responses to the consultation below I can
            significantly reduce the time and mental load required for others to

          <h2>Copyright and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <h3>
            4 Do you agree that option 3 - a data mining exception which allows
            right holders to reserve their rights, supported by transparency
            measures - is most likely to meet the objectives set out above?
          </h3>
          <b>No. </b>A data mining exemption only ensures that rights holders
          see their work stolen in the largest possible scale imaginable to fuel
          the profits of organisations that seek to supplant those very rights
          holders. It's an enormous threat to the creative industries and cannot
          be allowed to occur if British Arts are to continue to be
          world-leading.
          <h3>5 Which option do you prefer and why?</h3>
          <b>Option 1 Strengthen copyright requiring licensing in all cases.</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          "AI Development" does not require the mass data scraping of
          intellectual property and copyrighted material. This only seems to be
          a requirement for specifically Generative AI firms, and only a subset
          of those firms making baseless promises about utility, profitability,
          and productivity that have so far proved imaginary. There is plenty of
          open source data, ways of licensing data fairly, funding required to
          provide adequate compensation where required. Wider AI development
          beyond Generative AI is in no way so restricted by the nature of their
          data collection practices and you need to stop pretending, or issuing
          consultations as if, Generative AI is representative of all AI
          technologies.
          <h2>Our proposed approach Exception with rights reservation </h2>
          <h3>
            6 Do you support the introduction of an exception along the lines
            outlined in section C of the consultation?
          </h3>
          No. This would be catastrophic to the creative industries and
          essentially render the rights of authors and artists null and void.
          Their work will continue to be taken from them without consent or
          compensation and used to drive Generative AI designed to replace them.
          Our creative industries will be replaced by cheap indistinct Generated
          sludge and the already precarious careers of British creators will
          cease to exist. This could be achieved in just a few years and take
          decades to recover from.
          <h3>
            8 If not, what other approach do you propose and how would that
            achieve the intended balance of objectives?
          </h3>
          Strengthened copyright regulations preventing Generative AI firms from
          collecting copyrighted and intellectual property data without consent
          or compensation.
          <h3>
            9 What influence, positive or negative, would the introduction of an
            exception along these lines have on you or your organisation?
          </h3>
          It would render the concept of having a career based on writing
          obsolete. My current, small, income from writing would cease to exist.
          Despite working as a software engineer I see no real benefits to my
          organisation or work in that field. The number of careers in
          Generative AI are negligible, the profits and productivity gains are
          non existent. Even the GenAI firms themselves don't make a profit. The
          impact is only negative.
          <h3>
            10 What action should a developer take when a reservation has been
            applied to a copy of a work?
          </h3>
          Not using it.
          <h3>
            11 What should be the legal consequences if a reservation is
            ignored?
          </h3>
          Fines, and if systematic, bans for the directors of the company. If
          the entire enterprise is based on such ignored reservations the
          company itself should be dissolved on top of fines and charges of
          theft. Fines should be compensated to those rights holders who were
          stolen from.
          <h3>
            12 Do you agree that rights should be reserved in machine-readable
            formats? Where possible, please indicate what you anticipate the
            cost of introducing and/or complying with a rights reservation in
            machine-readable format would be.
          </h3>
          This becomes irrelevant if you abandon this destructive approach and
          instead make rights reservation automatic. Such cost then becomes
          nill.
          <h2>Technical Standards</h2>
          <h3>
            13 Is there a need for greater standardisation of rights reservation
            protocols?
          </h3>
          Yes, given that they seem to be completely unenforceable at present.
          <h3>14 How can compliance with standards be encouraged?</h3>
          Fines based on percentage of revenue and consequences for the
          directors of companies engaging with non-compliance.
          <h3>
            15 Should the government have a role in ensuring this and, if so,
            what should that be?
          </h3>
          Yes, it's the government's job to enforce laws including those on
          copyright and intellectual property.
          <h2>Contracts and licensing</h2>
          <h3>
            16 Does current practice relating to the licensing of copyright
            works for AI training meet the needs of creators and performers?
          </h3>
          No, given they're ignored completely by Generative AI firms and the
          Government has done nothing about it.
          <h3>
            17 Where possible, please indicate the revenue/cost that you or your
            organisation receives/pays per year for this licensing under current
            practice.
          </h3>
          £0, as its taken en-masse without consent or compensation.
          <h3>
            18 Should measures be introduced to support licensing good practice?
          </h3>
          Yes, it's the government's job to enforce laws around licensing. This
          should be the duties of a regulator to enforce.
          <h3>
            19 Should the government have a role in encouraging collective
            licensing and/or data aggregation services?
          </h3>
          Yes
          <h3>20 If so, what role should it play?</h3> A single regulator should
          have responsibility over oversight and enforcement.
          <h3>
            21 Are you aware of any individuals or bodies with specific
            licensing needs that should be taken into account?
          </h3>
          Everyone involved in creating any kind of data used by these
          organisations including art and literature.
          <h2>Transparency</h2>
          <h3>
            22 Do you agree that AI developers should disclose the sources of
            their training material?
          </h3>
          Yes
          <h3>
            23 If so, what level of granularity is sufficient and necessary for
            AI firms when providing transparency over the inputs to generative
            models?
          </h3>
          Every distinct piece of data and creator of that data should be
          identifiable
          <h3>
            24 What transparency should be required in relation to web crawlers?
          </h3>
          Who web crawlers are owned by, what they are used for, and whether
          they ignore Robot.txt instructions
          <h3>
            25 What is a proportionate approach to ensuring appropriate
            transparency?
          </h3>
          Lack of adequate transparency should be fined at a percentage of
          corporate revenue and directors barred and/or companies banned from
          practice if they continue to systematically ignore transparency rules
          <h3>
            26 Where possible, please indicate what you anticipate the costs of
            introducing transparency measures on AI developers would be. Please
            indicate the anticipated costs of transparency measures.
          </h3>
          Low. Sufficient charges for breaches of transparency should be an
          adequate deterrent. Given that the UK Government already successfully
          chases non-compliance with BBC TV Licences on a wide scale such an
          operation should not be especially difficult or expensive
          <h3>
            27 How can compliance with transparency requirements be encouraged,
            and does this require regulatory underpinning?
          </h3>
          It requires regulatory underpinning. Without it such a compliance
          regime would be meaningless and completely require compliance from. It
          should be enforced with fines and corporate consequences.
          <h3>28 What are your views on the EU’s approach to transparency?</h3>
          Better than the UK's, given there actually is one
          <h2>Wider clarification of copyright law</h2>
          <h3>
            29 What steps can the government take to encourage AI developers to
            train their models in the UK and in accordance with UK law to ensure
            that the rights of right holders are respected?
          </h3>
          Sufficient investment in research and development in software and
          hardware, especially at universities, is sufficient to achieve this.
          Serious AI developers will follow academic success and the student
          expertise provided by these efforts. Nothing is needed for Generative
          AI developers, a relatively small slice of AI's broad potential. This
          is a bubble likely to burst and further investment will likely be
          wasted rather than being an investment into successful AI development.
          <h3>
            30 To what extent does the copyright status of AI models trained
            outside the UK require clarification to ensure fairness for AI
            developers and right holders?
          </h3>
          Use of data covered by rights by developers outside the UK should face
          the same regulatory regime as those within the UK - given that by
          scraping from creators in the UK they are operating here.
          <h3>
            31 Does the temporary copies exception require clarification in
            relation to AI training?
          </h3>
          Yes, it shouldn't apply to technologies that then keep the data from
          the copies as training data, as this is clearly not temporary.
          <h3>
            32 If so, how could this be done in a way that does not undermine
            the intended purpose of this exception?
          </h3>
          See above Encouraging research and innovation
          <h3>
            33 Does the existing data mining exception for non-commercial
            research remain fit for purpose?
          </h3>
          No, given OpenAI claimed to be non-profit until it suited them not to
          me. Such an exception should only apply for charitable and academic
          purposes.
          <h3>
            34 Should copyright rules relating to AI consider factors such as
            the purpose of an AI model, or the size of an AI firm?
          </h3>
          No, as they frequently lie about the purpose. This is how the existing
          Generative AI firms have gained such a significant level of
          investment, by lying about what they are capable of delivering with
          that investment.
          <h2>
            CGW Policy Option 0 No legal change, maintain the current provisions
          </h2>
          <h3>
            35 Are you in favour of maintaining current protection for
            computer-generated works? If yes, please explain whether and how you
            currently rely on this provision.
          </h3>
          Yes Generative AIs don't create, there is no human owner of their
          products
          <h3>
            36 Do you have views on how the provision should be interpreted?
          </h3>
          It should continue to not apply copyright to the product of Generative
          AI models
          <h2>
            CGW Policy Option 1 Reform the current protection to clarify its
            scope
          </h2>
          <h3>
            37 Would CGW legislation benefit from greater legal clarity, for
            example to clarify the originality requirement? If so, how should it
            be clarified?
          </h3>
          If a majority of an image is the product of Generative AI then it
          should not be covered by copyright. If the majority is original work
          independently created then it should be
          <h3>
            38 Should other changes be made to the scope of CGW protection?
          </h3>
          No
          <h3>
            39 Would reforming the CGW provision have an impact on you or your
            organisation? If so, how? Please provide quantitative information
            where possible.
          </h3>
          Significant negative impact. Allowing Generative AI products to be
          copyrightable will allow people to functionally use these models to
          recreate the work of authors and artists almost exactly, then
          copyright it as if it's their own, creating a legal mess over
          ownership. Generative AI firms have the finances to fight such cases.
          Authors and artists largely do not.
          <h2>CGW Policy Option 2 Remove specific protection for CGWs</h2>
          <h3>
            40 Are you in favour of removing copyright protection for
            computer-generated works without a human author?
          </h3>
          Yes. Without a human author there is no person to own copyright.
          <h3>
            41 What would be the economic impact of doing this? Please provide
            quantitative information where possible. Please provide further
            comments
          </h3>
          The status quo. It would prevent harm to the arts industry.
          <h3>
            42 Would the removal of the current CGW provision affect you or your
            organisation? Please provide quantitative information where possible
          </h3>
          Significant positive effect. It would prevent the eradication of the
          arts community by Generative AI prompters.
          <h2>Infringement and liability relating to AI-generated content</h2>
          <h3>
            43 Does the current approach to liability in AI-generated outputs
            allow effective enforcement of copyright?
          </h3>
          No. There currently isn't any effective enforcement of copyright in
          this area
          <h3>
            44 What steps should AI providers take to avoid copyright infringing
            outputs?
          </h3>
          Given they have access to all of the text and images they used to
          train their data it would be simple for them to have a comparative
          algorithm that compared generated data to that training data and
          prevented its publication if they had a very high level of similarity
          to the point it would be copyright infringement.
          <h2>AI Output labelling</h2>
          <h3>
            45 Do you agree that generative AI outputs should be labelled as AI
            generated? If so, what is a proportionate approach, and is
            regulation required?
          </h3>
          As long as the metadata of an image captures that it is AI Generated
          that should be sufficient for general imagery. For anything that
          replicates real people or places it should be clear visually that it
          is AI generated. For AI generated creative products it should be clear
          before consumption of the product.
          <h3>
            46 How can government support development of emerging tools and
            standards, reflecting the technical challenges associated with
            labelling tools?
          </h3>
          The important thing is for there to be a clear and universal standard
          that Generative AI companies must abide by. That should be set by
          Government or a Government supported regulator.
          <h3>
            47 What are your views on the EU's approach to AI output labelling?
          </h3>
          It should be broader than the relatively narrow regulations on
          specific usage of Generative AI Digital replicas and other issues
          <h3>
            48 To what extent would the approach(es) outlined in the first part
            of this consultation, in relation to transparency and text and data
            mining, provide individuals with sufficient control over the use of
            their image and voice in AI outputs?
          </h3>
          They wouldn't, given you're suggesting that unless someone actively
          reserves the rights to their own image and voice then they lose it.
          This right should be automatic and permanent, with any permissions
          granted being revocable.
          <h3>
            49 Could you share your experience or evidence of AI and digital
            replicas to date?
          </h3>
          They are now widespread, used to create misinformation in politics and
          harassment of individuals (both public and private). They are a menace
          to our society.
          <h2>Other emerging issues</h2>
          <h3>
            50 Is the legal framework that applies to AI products that interact
            with copyright works at the point of inference clear? If it is not,
            what could the government do to make it clearer?
          </h3>
          <b>No.</b>There isn't any, so any clarity would be an improvement. AI
          companies should need to check whether supplied data is copyrighted
          and reject it if so.
          <h3>
            51 What are the implications of the use of synthetic data to train
            AI models and how could this develop over time, and how should the
            government respond?
          </h3>
          Synthetic data is a positive development and should be encouraged as
          it reduces the use of copyrighted and intellectual property data.
          <h3>
            52 What other developments are driving emerging questions for the
            UK’s copyright framework, and how should the government respond to
            them?
          </h3>
          Social media platforms are becoming platforms for the sharing of
          generated misinformation produced by Generative AI. These platforms
          should be expected to take action against such practices. Generative
          AI regulations should also apply to publishers and platforms for those
          products, such as Amazon.
